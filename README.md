# Adaptive-Controller-Project
This project contains 2 methods for implementing an adaptive controller on a 2-link robot arm.

Method-1: Adaptive control through linear paramterization.

Method-2: Adaptive control without linear paramterization (using Function approximation techniques).

Vrep-Matlab file contains the code for implementing adaptive controller using FAT technique and simulating the two link arm in Vrep.
